PSYLIGHTBOOKMARK PROTOCOL
  
  Well, this project is not supposed to be taken too seriously, so I'm not
  really investing on security for the time being. Passwords will be salted and
  hashed and an authentication system similar to http (token based auth.) will
  be provided. Treat the software as insecure.

  The protocol is plaintext. Fields are delimited by the pipe '|' symbol.
