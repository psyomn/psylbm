PSYLIGHTBOOKMARK

  This is a very small application that aims to be a light server, with a tiny
  protocol, that aims to store bookmarks of various media, be it books, manga,
  comics, whatever.
  
  The protocol will be provided, and whoever wants to use this tiny server can
  implement something in their own application. If you're interested, see the
  file PROTOCOL.
