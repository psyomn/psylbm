PSYLIGHTBOOKMARK

  This is a very small application that aims to be a light server, with a tiny
  protocol, that aims to store bookmarks of various media, be it books, manga,
  comics, whatever.

  Don't treat the software as secure. This was coded for fun, and maybe aspects
  of security might have been neglected. 
  
  The protocol will be provided, and whoever wants to use this tiny server can
  implement something in their own application. If you're interested, see the
  file PROTOCOL.
