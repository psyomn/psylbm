TODO

  * Named bookmarks
  * server values should not be hardcoded (localhost, portnumber etc)
  * Add name to a bookmark, so that if a user has multiple bookmarks on a single
    book, the user would be able to discern the difference.
  * Think of a way to make password resets possible.
  * Maybe allow other people to view your bookmarks if you want (using a 'set'
    command in the protocol or something like that).
